# LD40_DontBeGreedy
Trying to make a game in the spirit of classic Donkey Kong for Ludum Dare 40. To implement the theme "The more you have, the worse it is" you have to choose your items before you start a level, each item will increase your weight, though slow you down and decrease your jump height.
